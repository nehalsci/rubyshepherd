# RubyShepherd
This is the repository that contains the basic program files that I wrote while learning (actually re-learning) Ruby language.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
I am using [Replit's online IDE](https://replit.com/@nehalsci/TheRubyShepherd) to work with this repository and files.

## About the name
It has nothing to do with Shepherd and that it came to my mind randomly. Let us focus on the programs and not sheeps.

## Want to help?
If you are an experienced Ruby developer, and found my code hilarious, and that I should have done this and that for betterment. Then create an [issue](https://github.com/nehalsci/rubyshepherd/issues) on this repository and let me know so I can learn and improve myself.
